Luna 2.1
========

Luna is a portable command-line converter of Lua programs to TNS TI-Nspire documents, compatible with OS 3.0.2 and later.

It can also be used to convert any TI-Nspire problems in XML format to TNS documents.

## Usage

* Lua program conversion:    `luna INFILE.lua OUTFILE.tns`
* Problem conversion:        `luna Problem1.xml OUTFILE.tns`
* Multiple files:            `luna Document.xml Problem1.xml [Problem2.xml...] OUTFILE.tns`

If the input is `-`, it reads the file from the standard input.  
Make sure to encode your Lua or Problem file in UTF-8 if it contains special characters. You can also pack arbitrary files like images into the TNS.
